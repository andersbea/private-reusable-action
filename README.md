# Private Reusable Action
An example of a reusable action within a private repository, able to be used from a seperate private repository. This example is within a single repository, but would for all practical reasons be within two seperate repositories. 

Check out my article [Reusable workflows in private repositories]() on medium for the full guide on what steps to take, in order to implement a private reusable action.
